This repository contains workflow templates and GitHub Actions to be reused in other repositories.
Workflows in the templates folder will be searchable in the GitHub UI when creating a new workflow. This is the only [special repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/creating-workflow-templates-for-your-organization) that can do this.

## contribute
